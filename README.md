# Garbage-Collector
Implementation of a smart pointer. You can think of this as implementing your own garbage collector, to use a concept from other programming languages. Building this project helped understand both how to work with pointers and references, and also why smart pointers are so important to modern C++ programming. 

# To run the code
g++ -o compiled.o main.cpp -std=c++11 -Wall
